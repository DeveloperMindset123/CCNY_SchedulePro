# expo-router-starter-kit 🏎️📱

Expo-router-starter-kit is a streamlined template for building cross-platform mobile apps with Expo. This template provides a starting point with updated features and simplified components for efficient development. 

NOTE: This is a Sandbox environment (Expo Go)

## 💻 Installation

```bash
# Clone and create a new repository from this template
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

   ```bash
   npm install || yarn i
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start || yarn start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
